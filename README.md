# üöÄ DailyCodingJoy üöÄ

Welcome to my coding playground, where I tackle the brain-teasers from [DailyCodingProblem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of C and C++. Because who said problem-solving can't be fun?

## What's Inside?

The folder structure is as straightforward as a piece of cake:

- **YYYYMMDD**: Each folder is like a delicious slice of time, containing the problem's readme, the 'src' folder with all the coding magic, and a makefile that's your personal code chef. Cook up some C or C++ goodness with just a make command! üç≥

- **src**: This is where the coding wizardry happens. Dive in and discover the mystical solutions to coding riddles. Warning: May contain traces of magic and caffeine.

- **makefile**: Your personal assistant in the kitchen of coding. Stir up the code cauldron with a sprinkle of 'make' magic. Brew, compile, and test - all in one place.

## Why C and C++?

Because why limit the fun to just one language? I've embraced the spirit of adventure and tackled problems meant for Pythonistas with the elegance of C and C++. Who said C and C++ can't be the life of the party?

Feel free to dive into the folders, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the show! üçø‚ú®
