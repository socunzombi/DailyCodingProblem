# üöÄ DailyCodingJoy üöÄ

Welcome to my coding playground, where I tackle the brain-teasers from [DailyCodingProblem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of C and C++. Because who said problem-solving can't be fun?

## Prerequisites

Before you jump into the coding joy, make sure you have the following essentials:

- **C and C++ Compilers**: Ensure you have the necessary compilers installed for both C and C++. Popular choices include GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for C, and G++ for C++. You can install them based on your operating system:

  - For Linux:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    ```

  - For macOS (using Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install gcc
    ```

  - For Windows (using MinGW or MSYS):
    Install MinGW or MSYS and add the bin directory to your system's PATH.

- **Code Editor**: Choose a code editor of your preference. Whether it's Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or any other editor, pick one that suits your style. The coding joy is best experienced with a comfortable editor by your side.

## What's Inside?

The folder structure is as straightforward as a piece of cake:

- **YYYYMMDD**: Each folder is like a delicious slice of time, containing the problem's readme, the 'src' folder with all the coding magic, and a makefile that's your personal code chef. Cook up some C or C++ goodness with just a make command! üç≥

- **src**: This is where the coding wizardry happens. Dive in and discover the mystical solutions to coding riddles. Warning: May contain traces of magic and caffeine.

- **makefile**: Your personal assistant in the kitchen of coding. Stir up the code cauldron with a sprinkle of 'make' magic. Brew, compile, and test - all in one place.

## Why C and C++?

Why stick to just one language when you can have the best of both worlds? In this coding carnival, I've chosen to dance with two partners: the classical elegance of C and the object-oriented charm of C++.

- **C for General Programs**: When it comes to versatility and low-level control, C is the language of choice. Whether it's algorithms, data structures, or just general programming wizardry, C stands as the silent maestro, orchestrating the symphony of efficient and robust solutions.

- **C++ for Object-Oriented Pizzazz**: For problems that demand the finesse of object-oriented design, C++ takes the spotlight. The encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism bring an extra layer of sophistication to the solutions. It's not just code; it's an object-oriented soir√©e.

So, why limit the fun when you can have the best of both languages? Whether you're slicing through algorithms in C or dancing with objects in C++, this repository is a celebration of the diverse flavors that C and C++ bring to the coding party.
