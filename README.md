# üöÄ DailyCodingJoy üöÄ

Welcome to my coding playground, where I tackle the brain-teasers from [DailyCodingProblem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of C, C++, and Rust. Because who said problem-solving can't be fun?

## Prerequisites

Before you jump into the coding joy, make sure you have the following essentials:

- **C, C++, and Rust Compilers**: Ensure you have the necessary compilers installed for C, C++, and Rust.

  - For C and C++:
    - For Linux:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install build-essential
      ```
    - For macOS (using Homebrew):
      ```bash
      brew install gcc
      ```
    - For Windows (using MinGW or MSYS):
      Install MinGW or MSYS and add the bin directory to your system's PATH.

  - For Rust:
    - Install Rust by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

- **Code Editor**: Choose a code editor of your preference. Whether it's Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or any other editor, pick one that suits your style. The coding joy is best experienced with a comfortable editor by your side.

## What's Inside?

The folder structure is as straightforward as a piece of cake:

- **problem_YYYYMMDD**: Each folder is like a delicious slice of time, containing the problem's readme, the 'src' folder with all the coding magic, and a makefile that's your personal code chef. Cook up some C, C++, or Rust goodness with just a make command! üç≥

- **src**: This is where the coding wizardry happens. Dive in and discover the mystical solutions to coding riddles. Warning: May contain traces of magic and caffeine.

- **makefile**: Your personal assistant in the kitchen of coding. Stir up the code cauldron with a sprinkle of 'make' magic for C and C++. For Rust, you can use `cargo build` directly.

## Why C, C++, and Rust?

Why stick to just one or two languages when you can have the best of three worlds? In this coding carnival, I've chosen to dance with three partners: the classical elegance of C, the object-oriented charm of C++, and the modern flair of Rust.

- **C for General Programs**: When it comes to versatility and low-level control, C is the language of choice. Whether it's algorithms, data structures, or just general programming wizardry, C stands as the silent maestro, orchestrating the symphony of efficient and robust solutions.

- **C++ for Object-Oriented Pizzazz**: For problems that demand the finesse of object-oriented design, C++ takes the spotlight. The encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism bring an extra layer of sophistication to the solutions. It's not just code; it's an object-oriented soir√©e.

- **Rust for Modern Elegance**: Rust brings a modern and safe alternative to the mix. With a focus on memory safety without sacrificing performance, Rust is perfect for tackling contemporary coding challenges.

So, why limit the fun when you can have the best of three languages? Whether you're slicing through algorithms in C, dancing with objects in C++, or exploring modern elegance in Rust, this repository is a celebration of the diverse flavors that C, C++, and Rust bring to the coding party.
