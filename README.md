# üöÄ DailyCodingJoy üöÄ

Welcome to my coding playground, where I tackle the brain-teasers from [DailyCodingProblem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of C and C++. Because who said problem-solving can't be fun?

## What's Inside?

The folder structure is as straightforward as a piece of cake:

- **YYYYMMDD**: Each folder is like a delicious slice of time, containing the problem's readme, the 'src' folder with all the coding magic, and a makefile that's your personal code chef. Cook up some C or C++ goodness with just a make command! üç≥

- **src**: This is where the coding wizardry happens. Dive in and discover the mystical solutions to coding riddles. Warning: May contain traces of magic and caffeine.

- **makefile**: Your personal assistant in the kitchen of coding. Stir up the code cauldron with a sprinkle of 'make' magic. Brew, compile, and test - all in one place.

## Why C and C++?

Why stick to just one language when you can have the best of both worlds? In this coding carnival, I've chosen to dance with two partners: the classical elegance of C and the object-oriented charm of C++.

- **C for General Programs**: When it comes to versatility and low-level control, C is the language of choice. Whether it's algorithms, data structures, or just general programming wizardry, C stands as the silent maestro, orchestrating the symphony of efficient and robust solutions.

- **C++ for Object-Oriented Pizzazz**: For problems that demand the finesse of object-oriented design, C++ takes the spotlight. The encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism bring an extra layer of sophistication to the solutions. It's not just code; it's an object-oriented soir√©e.

So, why limit the fun when you can have the best of both languages? Whether you're slicing through algorithms in C or dancing with objects in C++, this repository is a celebration of the diverse flavors that C and C++ bring to the coding party.

Feel free to dive into the folders, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the show! üçø‚ú®
